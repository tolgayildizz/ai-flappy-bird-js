# Flappy Bird with Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm

A flappy bird game developed using React.js and the Neural Network library. The game has a logic that produces a new generation of birds with what they have learned during the time that a certain number of birds are born and hit the obstacles. The more developing birds in each obstacle aim to mutate to ensure the birth of the perfect bird.
